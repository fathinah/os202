# Top 10 List of Week 01

1. [Virtualization](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/)<br>
Allows one or more "guest" operating systems to run on virtual machines hosted by a single physical machine and the virtual machine manager. Useful for cross-platform development and support. For example, I could run Linux on a virtual machine, hosted by Oracle VM VirtualBox on a Windows based personal computer. I would have full root access to the virtual machine, and if it crashed, the underlying Windows machine should be unaffected.

2. [Cloud computing](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/)<br>
Cloud computing delivers computing, storage, and applications as a service over a network. Types of cloud computing: public cloud - available to anyone willing to pay for the service, private cloud - run by a company for internal use only, hybrid cloud - a cloud with both public and private components, software as a service (SAAS) - applications such as word processors available via the internet, platform as a service (PAAS) - a software stack available for application use, such as a database server, infrastructure as a service (IAAS) - servers or storage available on the internet, such as backup servers, photo storage, or file storage.

3. [Free and open-source software]()<br>
Open-Source software is published with the source code, so that anyone can see and optionally modify the code. It  is often developed and maintained by a small army of loosely connected often unpaid programmers, each working towards the common good. Free software is licensed to allow no-cost use, redistribution, and modification. GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris are examples of popular open-source systems.

4. [Linux](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/index.htm)<br>
Linux is an open source Unix-like operating system which typically packaged in a Linux distribution. There are hundreds of Linux distribution as can be seen here ( including the rank ) https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=popularity . I am using Debian and Ubuntu for this course. Linux is often referred as GNU/Linux because it was built from the components of GNU software.

5. [Regex](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-regular-expressions.htm)<br>
A regular expression is a string that can be used to describe several sequences of characters which use largely in Linux commands. This above website gives me a better understanding about regex in Unix/Linux.

6. [Unix vs Linux](https://opensource.com/article/18/5/differences-between-linux-and-unix)<br>
I was confused about these two terms; do they refer to the same thing? As I skim through the above website, I now get a better understanding of these two different yet share the same goals operating systems. I recommend anyone to learn hands-on Unix/Linux commands and shell scripting in this link https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/index.htm !

7. [System Calls](https://lms.onnocenter.or.id/wiki/index.php/OS:_Mengerti_System_Call#Secara_Umum)<br>
System calls provide a means for user or application programs to call upon the services of the operating system. They are mostly written in C or C++. The link above shows how to make a system call.

8. [Kernel](https://lms.onnocenter.or.id/wiki/index.php/Kernel)<br>
Kernel is the heart of OS which facilitates interaction between hardware and software. Users communicate with the kernel through a program known as the shell. I was so abstract with the idea of it, although it keep being mentioned when explaining what Linux is, until I found this article in Bahasa.

9. [Command-line interface, interpreter and Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_command-line_interpreters)<br>
CLI serves an interface that execute operating system’s functions or services. The program which handles the interface is called a command-line interpreter. The shell is a command line interpreter; it translates commands entered by the user and converts them into a language that is understood by the kernel. In windows, we can fund cmd.exe, windows PowerShell, and in Linux we can use bash, bourne, or perl shell. 

10. [VI commands](http://web.mit.edu/merolish/Public/vi-ref.pdf )<br>
At first, I though VI is an extension of Unix command, but I was wrong. It was just a text editor that expands the capability of Unix commands (such as writing, creating new files, etc.). Go try them out by referring to the above link’s cheat sheet!
